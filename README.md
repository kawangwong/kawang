# hi! :wave: a little about me :boy:
A passionate technologist with a goal to become a part of the DevOps. I'm a t(h)inker(er) whos looking to understand the world just a little bit more. By learning to understand things at its root, we can find ways to improve ourselves and the world we live in.

As a tinkerer, I've spent time reading code, modifying code and understanding (and somewhat successfully grasp) concepts in shell scripting, python scripting and basic hardware aspects to utilization of electronic switch building for GPIO of Raspberry Pi and Arduino-based devices. Being an immigrant, the hardest pill to swallow was spending money when you didn't need to. After spending money the second time to fix a computer problem, I found myself vowing that I would never spend money for IT support again, from then on, I played around with every piece of technology that would allow me to learn its secrets.

I'm a self taught Linux user thanks to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and the large swath of the internet community. Through my pi, I learned how to create small scaled projects including home VPNs using PPTP, OpenVPN, DHCP server management and DNS servers. I've worked on deploying open source projects including the Magic Mirror and Docker for utilizing of software such as Nginx, Plex Media Servers, and VPN Client services. In this journey, I've learned Networking concepts and have delved into the foundations of it such as OSI layering, CIDR block notations, port forwarding rules and subnetting.

I have a passion for understanding and implementing ideas for assistive technology to improve the lives of individuals with impairments and create projects for engagement in meaningful therapeutic experiences. This includes small projects using Arduinos for creating switches for engagement with Desktops for control of video games or even connecting consumer grade technologies with existing IoT infrastructure.

In learning all of this, I've also contributed to writing a blog post for a friend, which includes an accessible way for consumers to create their own Telehealth set up, which was praised by colleagues and interest groups for helping therapists set up their home [infrastructure for telehealth](https://otvijay.com/2020/08/23/comprehensive-guide-to-setup-for-telehealth/)
